    # Sender Addresses. You can have as many as you want, defined by a string identifier.

    # These are the packages in which TemplateMailer will look for templates, in the Resources/EmailTemplates folder.
    # If you use partials or layouts, they are expected in the Partials/ and Layouts/ subfolders of EmailTemplates.
    # The array is sorted by the keys before template loading is done, so you can define overrides by just setting lower numbers as keys.
    templatePackages: []
      # 99999: 'Sandstorm.TemplateMailer' # This is just an example.

    # You can pass arbitrary Settings paths here. They will be resolved and set on all email templates as default variables.
    # If you pass values with the same keys during calls to sendTemplateEmail(), they will override these defaults.
    defaultTemplateVariables:
      baseUri: 'Neos.Flow.http.baseUri'
